# RL-X

A framework for Reinforcement Learning research.

## Highlights

- üí° **Perfect to understand and prototype algorithms**:
    - One algorithm = One folder -> No backtracking through  parent classes
    - Algorithms can be easily copied out of RL-X
- ‚öíÔ∏è **Known DL libraries**: Implementations in PyTorch, TorchScript or Jax (Flax)
- ‚ö° **Maximum speed**: Jax versions are a lot faster than PyTorch
- üß™ **Mix and match and extend**: Generic interfaces between algorithms and environments
- üìà **Experiment tracking**: Console logging, Saving models, Tensorboard, Weights and Biases

## Implemented Algorithms

## Usable Environments
- [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)
    - MuJoCo
- [Envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool)
    - MuJoCo
    - Atari
    - Classic control
    - DeepMind Control Suite

Most of them only have one reference environment implemented.
To try out more just change the environment name in the create_env.py files or add a proper new folder for it.

For further infos on how to add more environments and algorithms read the respective README files.
