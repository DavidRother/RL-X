# Custom MuJoCo Environments

Contains an example for an custom MuJoCo environment.

The example uses the Ant robot and the task is to track a given local velocity command.


This example can be used as a template for other custom MuJoCo environments, as it contains all necessary handling of the MuJoCo physics engine via its Python bindings and an implementation of a GLFW viewer.
