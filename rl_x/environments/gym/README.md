# Gymnasium

Contains the environments from [Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) (former OpenAI Gym).

The reference implementation contains Pong-v5 for Atari, CartPole-v1 for classic control and Humanoid-v4 for MuJoCo.

For testing other Gymnasium environments, the environment name can simply be changed in the create_env.py file.
Or for proper usage, create a new directory for the environment.
